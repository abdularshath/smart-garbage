iot based project smart garbage which is moniter garbage level and automatic open and close
Smart Garbage Bin

# Overview

The Smart Garbage Bin project introduces a sensor-based system aimed at revolutionizing waste management. This automated solution enhances user convenience, maintains hygiene, and optimizes waste collection schedules.

# Features

Ultrasonic Sensor: Monitors the garbage fill level and provides real-time data for timely disposal.

IR Sensor: Detects the presence of objects near the bin and triggers the lid mechanism.

Servo Motor: Automatically opens and closes the bin lid for hands-free waste disposal.

Mobile Application Integration: Notifies users when the bin is full, preventing overflow and ensuring efficient collection.

Hygienic and Eco-Friendly: Reduces manual contact and promotes cleaner surroundings.

# Components Required

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) – for garbage level detection

IR Sensor – for object detection

Servo Motor – to open/close the bin lid

Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) – for processing sensor data

Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32) – for IoT connectivity and mobile app integration

Power Supply – for system operation

Garbage Bin – physical container for waste

# How It Works

Garbage Level Monitoring: The ultrasonic sensor continuously checks the garbage level inside the bin.

Object Detection: The IR sensor detects an approaching object (e.g., a hand holding trash).

Automated Lid Mechanism: When an object is detected, the servo motor automatically opens the lid. Once the object is removed, the lid closes.

Real-time Notifications: When the garbage reaches a predefined level, the system sends an alert to users via a mobile application.

# Installation & Setup

Assemble the Hardware: Connect the sensors, servo motor, microcontroller, and power supply as per the circuit diagram.

Upload the Code: Program the microcontroller using Arduino IDE or a relevant platform.

Configure the Mobile App: Connect the system to a mobile application via Wi-Fi for notifications.

Test the System: Ensure proper sensor functionality and lid automation.

# Applications

Households: Enhances waste disposal convenience.

Public Places: Reduces manual intervention and maintains cleanliness.

Offices & Institutions: Promotes better waste management practices.

# Future Enhancements

AI-based Waste Sorting: Automating segregation of recyclable and non-recyclable waste.

Solar Power Integration: To make the system more sustainable.

GPS-based Collection Monitoring: Optimizing waste collection routes.
